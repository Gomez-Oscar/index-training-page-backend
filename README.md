you need to add two folders, "recordings" and "slides-pdf".

inside "recordings" you need to create another two folders, "images" and "videos".

inside "images" you need to create another two folders, "images" and "pdfs".

all images in .jpg, videos in .mp4 and slides in .pdf.

(also you need to recover the node_modules folder)
